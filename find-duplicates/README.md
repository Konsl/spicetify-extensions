# find-duplicates
[Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli) extension to view all releases of a song. 
* Right click a song and select "View Duplicates" to see a list of all it's releases.
* Look at the indicator next to a song's heart icon to see how many duplicates of that song you have saved.
## ‚öôÔ∏è Install
Copy `find-duplicates/dist/find-duplicates.js` into your [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli) extensions directory:
| **Platform** | **Path**                                                                               |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linux**      | `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/spicetify/Extensions/` |
| **MacOS**      | `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions` or `$SPICETIFY_CONFIG/Extensions`                   |
| **Windows**    | `%appdata%/spicetify/Extensions/`                                               |

After putting the extension file into the correct folder, run the following command to install the extension:
```
spicetify config extensions find-duplicates.js
spicetify apply
```
Note: Using the `config` command to add the extension will always append the file name to the existing extensions list. It does not replace the whole key's value.

Or you can manually edit your `config-xpui.ini` file. Add your desired extension filenames in the extensions key, separated them by the | character.
Example:

```ini
[AdditionalOptions]
...
extensions = shuffle+.js|trashbin.js|find-duplicates.js
```

Then run:

```
spicetify apply
```

## ü™Ñ  Usage
- Right click a song and select "View Duplicates".
- **Note**: On it's first launch, the extension has to build a list of International Standard Recording Codes for the songs saved in your library. During this time, the "View Duplicates" feature may not be available for every song. You will see an error message instead.
