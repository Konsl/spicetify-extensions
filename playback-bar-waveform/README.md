This extension is heavily inspired by [Spotlab](https://github.com/SPOTLAB-Live)'s [Spicetify Waveform](https://github.com/SPOTLAB-Live/Spicetify-waveform).
However, it works a bit differently and is explicitly not *based* on the other extension (i.e. no code is copied, my extension is completely original).

I made this extension to be more compatible with third party themes and extensions as well as to display the waveform in a slightly different way (which you may like or dislike, you can always use either extension, it's your choice).
